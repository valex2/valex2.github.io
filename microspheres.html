									<h2>Microspheres for Drug Delivery</h2>
									<p>Applications in Antipsychotics and Vaccines</p>
								</header>

								<p>Drugs have formed the cornerstone of therapeutic intervention for ailments for the past five millennia. Early hunter-gatherers from <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1879981718300883">3300 BC</a> were found carrying antibacterial fungi and antiparasitic ferns, while Central Asian peoples used psychoactive substances like <a href="http://www.botany.hawaii.edu/faculty/wong/BOT135/Lect20a.htm">Amanita muscaria</a> in religious rituals over 4000 years ago. However, as human ingenuity has increased, our reliance on the natural world for sourcing drugs has declined. Particularly, the recent development of chemical synthesis has led to the discovery of novel therapeutics with capabilities far beyond those of past herbal medicine.</p>

								<p>Despite the ease of synthesis of such compounds, one of the main roadblocks to current treatment is drug delivery. Many new pharmaceuticals are either insoluble in the body, unstable, or too potent to be delivered in traditional methods such as capsules, tablets, or injections. Even compounds that can use pre-existing treatment methods need to be dosed so frequently that they are <a href="http://ijpsr.com/bft-article/microspheres-as-drug-carriers-for-controlled-drug-delivery-a-review/?view=fulltext">infeasible for most patients</a>.</p>

								<p>Researchers are interested in sustained-release drug delivery systems that allow fine-tuned delivery of compounds at a pre-determined rate. One such system is microsphere polymers, which show promise because of their ability to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-021-00698-w">maintain therapeutic drug concentrations</a> for extended periods. Microsphere polymers would obviate the need for exacting dosing regimens while improving drug efficacy and patient quality of life. Particularly, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3347861/">poly lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) polymers</a> are the most promising candidates for microsphere drug delivery because they are generally biocompatible and degrade well in the body. When injected via syringe, the slow erosion of the PLGA polymer prolongs the release of the unstable medication into the bloodstream. Recent studies have shown that such microsphere polymers are highly customizable; the polymer diameter, molecular weight, and drug to polymer ratio can be controlled to regulate the duration and rate of drug release while providing <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3601676/">up to 6-month drug delivery times</a>.</p>

								<p>Microsphere polymers can solve long-standing problems in drug delivery for diseases like schizophrenia. Risperidone is a <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7514366/">safe antipsychotic</a> that is effective against a wide range of schizophrenia symptoms, including hallucinations, delusions, and movement disorders. However, the pharmacological benefits of Risperidone rely on adherence to oral therapy – which often needs to be administered once or twice daily. This is not ideal for schizophrenia patients who resist treatment and have a <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10078501/">five-fold risk of relapse</a> due to noncompliance. Microspheres as a Risperidone delivery method are a near-perfect solution: their sustained drug release can radically reduce dosing frequency, leading to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122341/">increased adherence</a> to treatment regimens and better treatment outcomes. Most promisingly, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3927762/">recent pharmacological studies</a> have shown that Risperidone-PLGA formulations have the potential to extend dosing frequencies to 7-14 days per administration. Such microspheres would drastically increase the quality of life of schizophrenia patients while avoiding the physical and financial costs of rehospitalization due to relapse from treatment non-adherence.</p>

								<p>Additionally, tighter control of polymer degradation opens possibilities for the use of microspheres in controlled-release vaccine applications. Many vaccines require repeated vaccinations to achieve long-lasting immunity. The anthrax vaccine, for example, which is important in nations where routine livestock vaccination is not practiced, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/anthrax-vaccine">requires three doses every two weeks</a>, followed by another three doses at six, 12, and 18 months after the first dose. Numerous other vaccines, including diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (DTaP), rotavirus, Pneumococcus, and polio <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/hcp/imz/child-adolescent.html">require three-plus doses</a> within the first 12 months of birth. These multiple injection requirements are particularly challenging for populations with limited medical access; <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/immunization-coverage">WHO estimates</a> suggest that over 23 million children missed out on vaccination in 2020, most of which were concentrated in countries with strained health systems.</p>

								<p>Microspheres with pulsatile delivery – that can rapidly release molecules in pre-defined time increments while remaining largely inactive during off-periods – are key. They avoid the infrastructure requirements of isolated injection dates while chemically ensuring that treatment is received in an appropriate timeframe. For example, <a href="https://aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1021/bp970128t">a recent study</a> has shown that varying the molecular weight of microspheres can yield lag phases in drug delivery ranging from 1-6 months. When the microspheres were applied to antimalarial antibodies in mice, they completely blocked malaria transmission to mosquitos after 40 days, whereas traditional multi-dose immunizations did not result in complete blocking of malarial transmission. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168365999000140?via%3Dihub">Another study</a> has even shown promise encapsulating rotavirus in triphasic microspheres, which sustained release in a regimen compliant fashion for over 200 days.</p>

								<p>Nonetheless, microsphere-based vaccines are a nascent technology ripe with problems. Synthesis of pulsatile delivery microspheres is a complex process, and ramping up production while keeping costs low is a major challenge. The long-term effects of prolonged nano-particle exposure and the potential toxicity of such microspheres are still being <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3607064/">evaluated</a>. And current manufacturing processes feature non-zero risks of the final product containing traces of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3607064/">“unacceptable solvents”</a> that will need to be ironed out before mass implementation. But, the research is promising; given enough time and resource investment microspheres could pave the way for the development of cheap, durable, and accessible immunizations.</p>

								<p>In all, PLGA-based microspheres show incredible promise for the future of drug delivery. When properly synthesized with their component therapeutic, they can provide a prolonged and carefully regulated rate of delivery, increase the life of drugs that are quickly destroyed by the body, and increase patient comfort, compliance, and quality of life. They solve niche problems in numerous biological applications, ranging from antipsychotics to vaccines. And as the technology advances, perhaps we will begin to see year-long or even decade-long lasting microsphere injections. The possibilities are endless, and the technology is at the cusp of adoption.</p>
